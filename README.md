# Advent of Code C++

From <https://adventofcode.com/2020>. Likely to late for every day, but hopefully it's the intention that counts ;)

## System requirements

- build-essentials (gcc)
- cmake

Only Linux/gcc has been tested. It might just work though on Windows/MSVC.

## Compile & run (Release)

```bash
./build/make.sh
./cmake-build-release/adventofcode
```

## Recompile & run (Debug)

```bash
./build/run.sh
```
